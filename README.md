# SDL2 Game Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple game using SDL2.
- Followed Limeoats Cavestory tutorial series

## Prerequisites

- SDL2
- tinyxml2 (already in the includes)

## Compilation

I used C++17, but your free to try other c++ versions.
Compiled with g++, but anything should work. Don't forget the SDL includes.

If compiling with Windows, make sure to have the required dll files.

# ~2700 lines of pure pleasure.
